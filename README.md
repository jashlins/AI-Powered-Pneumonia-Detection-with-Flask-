# AI Powered Pneumonia Detection with Flask
## Overview

This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model has been deployed as a web application using Flask, allowing users to upload X-ray images and receive predictions in real-time.

## Features

. Deep learning-based pneumonia detection.
. User-friendly web interface for image upload and result display
. Robust data preprocessing and augmentation for improved model accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia). It consists of X-ray images labeled as "Pneumonia" or "Normal."
